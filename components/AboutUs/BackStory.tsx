                        As an African living in Nigeria,
                        navigating the tech world can
                        be daunting. However,
                    </p>

                    <p className='text-7xl font-light leading-[77px] my-16'>
                        ‘every great story happens when someone decides not to give up’

                        or, in our case, ‘make it easier for others.’
                        This is the story of ILERI AROWO and
                        LOREON TECHNOLOGIES. When our founder
                        decided to fully switch to DevOps in
                        2021, he was faced with a number of linked challenges.
                        <br /><br />
                        At the start of his journey, there was no
                        standard way to acquire the skills needed
                        from a top-tier DevOps expert; the few
                        trainers available were largely expensive
                        and above the reach of the average African citizen living in Nigeria.</p>
                </article>
                <article className='basis-1/2'>
                    <p className='font-light text-xl leading-8  text-justify'>
                        Regardless, he managed to acquire all
                        the necessary skills through sheer determination.
                        Upon completing his training, he was presented
                        with a new challenge — most Nigerian companies
                        didn&apos;t pay as well as foreign companies.
                        He had to work twice as much as others for
                        way below-average pay compared to counterparts
                        from the USA, UK, Canada, and Germany.
                        Frustrated with the market conditions and
                        the need for better working conditions,
                        he started applying for foreign remote DevOps roles.
                        Despite several successful interviews,
                        he often got dropped for not having a permit
                        to work in those countries. His last resort
                        was to connect with a colleague who had a
                        DevOps job permit in the USA.
                        The idea was for the colleague to
                        outsource jobs to him. However,
                        the deal&apos;s conditions were unfair
                        in almost every way — a 4% pay from
                        the monthly salary despite doing 100%
                        of the Job. <br /><br /> As Albert Einstein once said,
                    </p>

                    <p className='text-7xl leading-[64px] font-light my-16'>
                        “We can not solve our problems
                        with the same level of thinking
                        that created them.”
                    </p>

                    <p className='font-light text-xl leading-8  text-justify'>
                        For this reason, coupled with the daunting
                        challenges
                        faced and a disadvantaged African tech market,
                        he decided to ‘make it easier for others’
                        through LOREON TECHNOLOGIES — a
                        software company based in the USA
                        that will eliminate all major issues
                        for existing and new DevOps technicians
                        living and working in Nigeria and Africa.
